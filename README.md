# Natural Disaster Management System
Disaster management essentially deals with the management of resources and information
towards a disastrous event and is measured by how efficiently, effectively and seamlessly one
coordinates these resources.

Through this website, the intent is to make people aware of impending disasters, dos and don'ts during a natural disaster and the measures to take in case of a natural disaster.
